            <summary>
            EA_Connect events enable Add-Ins to identify their type and to respond to Enterprise Architect start up.
            This event occurs when Enterprise Architect first loads your Add-In. Enterprise Architect itself is loading at this time so that while a Repository object is supplied, there is limited information that you can extract from it.
            The chief uses for EA_Connect are in initializing global Add-In data and for identifying the Add-In as an MDG Add-In.
            Also look at EA_Disconnect.

            <summary>
            The EA_GetMenuItems event enables the Add-In to provide the Enterprise Architect user interface with additional Add-In menu options in various context and main menus. When a user selects an Add-In menu option, an event is raised and passed back to the Add-In that originally defined that menu option.
            This event is raised just before Enterprise Architect has to show particular menu options to the user, and its use is described in the Define Menu Items topic.
            Also look at:
            - EA_MenuClick

            - Empty (Visual Basic/VB.NET) or null (C#) to indicate that no menu should be displayed.
            In the case of the top-level menu it should be a single string or an array containing only one item, or Empty/null.</returns>

            <summary>
            The EA_GetMenuState event enables the Add-In to set a particular menu option to either enabled or disabled. This is useful when dealing with locked packages and other situations where it is convenient to show a menu option, but not enable it for use.
            This event is raised just before Enterprise Architect has to show particular menu options to the user. Its use is described in the Define Menu Items topic.

            <summary>
            EA_MenuClick events are received by an Add-In in response to user selection of a menu option.
            The event is raised when the user clicks on a particular menu option. When a user clicks on one of your non-parent menu options, your Add-In receives a MenuClick event, defined as follows:
            Sub EA_MenuClick(Repository As EA.Repository, ByVal MenuName As String, ByVal ItemName As String)
            Notice that your code can directly access Enterprise Architect data and UI elements using Repository methods.

            <summary>
            The EA_Disconnect event enables the Add-In to respond to user requests to disconnect the model branch from an external project.
            This function is called when the Enterprise Architect closes. If you have stored references to Enterprise Architect objects (not particularly recommended anyway), you must release them here.
            In addition, .NET users must call memory management functions as shown below:
            GC.Collect();
            GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
            Also look at EA_Connect.

            <summary>
            EA_OnOutputItemClicked events inform Add-Ins that the user has clicked on a list entry in the system tab or one of the user defined output tabs.
            Usually an Add-In responds to this event in order to capture activity on an output tab they had previously created through a call to Repository.AddTab().
            Note that every loaded Add-In receives this event for every click on an output tab in Enterprise Architect - irrespective of whether the Add-In created that tab. Add-Ins should therefore check the TabName parameter supplied by this event to ensure that they are not responding to other Add-Ins' events.

When a key is retrieved from the Sparx Systems Keystore only the target Add-In will be called with the key.
            For the Add-In to validate itself against this key, the Add-In's EA_AddinLicenseValidate handler should return true to confirm that the license has been validated. As the EA_AddinLicenseValidate event is broadcast to all Add-Ins, one license can validate many Add-Ins.
            If an Add-In elects to handle a license key by returning true to EA_AddinLicenseValidate, it is called upon to provide a description of the license key through the EA_AddinLicenseGetDescription event.

            <summary>
            MDG_Merge enables the Add-In to jointly handle changes to both the model branch and the code project that the model branch is connected to. This event should be called whenever the user has asked to merge their model branch with its connected code project, or whenever the user has established a new connection to a code project. The purpose of this event is to enable the Add-In to interact with the user to perform a merge between the model branch and the connected project.
            Also look at MDG_Connect, MDG_PreMerge and MDG_PostMerge.
            Merge
            A merge consists of three major operations:
            - Export: Where newly created model objects are exported into code and made available to the code project.
            - Import: Where newly created code objects, Classes and such things are imported into the model.
            - Synchronize: Where objects available both to the model and in code are jointly updated to reflect changes made in either the model, code project or both.
            - Synchronize Type
            The Synchronize operation can take place in one of four different ways. Each of these ways corresponds to a value returned by SynchType:
            - None: (SynchType = 0) No synchronization is to be performed
            - Forward: (SynchType = 1) Forward synchronization, between the model branch and the code project is to occur
            - Reverse: (SynchType = 2) Reverse synchronization, between the code project and the model branch is to occur
            - Both: (SynchType = 3) Reverse, then Forward synchronization's are to occur.
            Object ID Format
            Each of the Object IDs listed in the string arrays described above should be composed in the following format:

            MDG_PostGenerate enables the Add-In to handle file changes caused by generation.
            This event is called after Enterprise Architect has prepared text to replace the existing contents of a file. Responding to this event enables the Add-In to write to the linked application's user interface rather than modify the file directly.
            When the contents of a file are changed, Enterprise Architect passes FileContents as a non-empty string. New files created as a result of code generation are also sent through this mechanism, enabling Add-Ins to add new files to the linked project's file list.
            When new files are created Enterprise Architect passes FileContents as an empty string. When a non-zero is returned by this function, the Add-In has successfully written the contents of the file. A zero value for the return indicates to Enterprise Architect that the file must be saved.

            A guard is a constraint that provides a fine-grained control over the firing of the transition. The guard is evaluated

            enabled; otherwise, it is disabled. Guards should be pure expressions without side effects. Guard expressions with

            <summary>
            CallOperationAction is an action that transmits an operation call request to the target object, where it may cause the
            invocation of associated behavior. The argument values of the action are available to the execution of the invoked
            behavior. If the action is marked synchronous, the execution of the call operation action waits until the execution of the
            invoked behavior completes and a reply transmission is returned to the caller; otherwise, execution of the action is
            complete when the invocation of the operation is established and the execution of the invoked operation proceeds
            concurrently with the execution of the calling behavior. Any values returned as part of the reply transmission are put on
            the result output pins of the call operation action. Upon receipt of the reply transmission, execution of the call operation
            action is complete.
